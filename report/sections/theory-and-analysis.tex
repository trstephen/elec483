\stub{Does this method hurt PSNR more than ours?}

Unless specifically designed to be otherwise, the largest frequency component of an image is its DC component.
The DCT process typically yields a DC value over 1000. Altering this value by $\pm 1$ results in almost no change to image quality.
This is the core principle at the heart of many compression algorithms.\citeneeded{}

Relative image quality is determined by the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) value, representing the effect of noise from the $DCT~\rightarrow~IDCT~\rightarrow~DCT$ process and distortion from the watermark.

\maybe{BCH codes?}
