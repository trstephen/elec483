\section{Theory and analysis}\label{sec:t-and-a}
Invisible digital watermarking means the ability to embed data in an image, in a manner that is recoverable, without causing significant alteration to the image or lowering its visual quality.
The key components of this solution involve taking the DCT coefficients of an image, quantizing those coefficients, and embedding a numerical data string containing the watermark information, as numerical offsets, into the DCT coefficients of the image.

The extraction of the watermark is done through comparing the DCT coefficients of the original quantized image, with the DCT coefficients of the watermarked image.
The offsets are mapped back to the numerical data string containing the watermark information.
