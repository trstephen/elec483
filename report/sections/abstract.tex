  This paper proposes a new image watermarking technique that encodes a plain-language phrase into an image DCT.
  We show how this method results in extremely small decreases to image quality and that embedding messages in the RGB layers results in less quality loss than embedding in the YCbCr layers.
  A method for two-party communication via watermarked images and a technique for blind watermark extraction are developed.
