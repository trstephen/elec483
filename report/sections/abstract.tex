  This paper proposes a new image watermarking technique that encodes a plain-language phrase into the image DCT.
  We show how this method results in extremely small decreases to image quality and that embedding messages in the R,G,B layers results in less quality loss than embedding in the Y,Cb,Cr layers.
  A method for two-party communication via watermarked images and a technique for blind watermark extraction are developed.
