\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conc}
This project succeeded in accomplishing its goal of demonstrating a procedure for watermarking digital files with almost no degradation of source image quality.
By creating a proof of concept which embedded a phrase into digital a image with minimal degradation to visual quality, and later extracted that same digital phrase with the help of BCH coding, this project demonstrated the potential and feasibility of this digital style of watermarking, in the real world.

The most obvious real world application of this technology is watermarking digital documents.
Another potential use for this methodology is in establishing a digital chain of ownership for sensitive internal documents.
Establishments will be able to keep an embedded digital record of the users who handled sensitive files. 
A record which they can trace back to the source of a leak or insurgence. Additionally, this form of embedding information in media can be used for covert communications between parties.
