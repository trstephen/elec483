\section{Introduction}\label{sec:intro}
The act of watermarking is synonymous with digital documents.
In fact, one would be hard pressed to find any sort of document, photo, or video on the internet, without some sort of watermarking or digital rights statement.
The problem is that traditional watermarking are the relics of a bygone era.
Most visual watermarking today relies on the brute-force technique of physically overlaying a secondary text or image branding over top of the content.
While this method makes the watermarking obvious, it does not employ any clever techniques, or even attempt to minimize the loss of visual quality of the original content.

This lack of an elegant digital watermarking solution led us to attempt to create a digital, invisible, embedded watermarking technique, for use on digital image files.
